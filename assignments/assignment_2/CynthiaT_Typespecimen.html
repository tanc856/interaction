    <div class="ImbueLight" id="notes1">We wanted a typeface like this for a side project but couldn't find one that felt right. </div>
    <div class="ImbueLight" id="notes2">So, we made Imbue. </div>


    <div class="ImbueLight" id="notes3"> The result is something crisp and curvy with two variable axes: </div>

    <div class="ImbueBlack" id="weight"> weight </div>
    <div class="ImbueLight" id="and"> and </div>
    <div class="ImbueLight" id="opticalsize"> optical size </div>


    <div class="ImbueLight" id="notes4"> Imbue is our first typeface to include a variable optical size. </div>

    <div class="ImbueLight" id="notes5"> Can you use the intended "10pt" (legible at small sizes) style with huge text? </div>
    <div class="ImbueRegular" id="absolutely"> Absolutely. </div>
    <div class="ImbueLight" id="notes6"> Can you use the super fine "100pt" style with tiny text?</div>
    <div class="ImbueRegular" id="yeahwhynot"> Yeah why not. </div>

    <div class="ImbueLight" id="notes8"> Excerpt from “Everything is Illuminated” by Jonathan Safran Foer </div>

    <div class="ImbueExtra-light" id="textsample1"> He awoke each morning with the desire to do right, to be a good and meaningful person, to be, as simple as it sounded and as impossible as it actually was, happy. And during the course of each day his heart would descend from his chest into his stomach. By early afternoon he was overcome by the feeling that nothing was right, or nothing was right for him, and by the desire to be alone. By evening he was fulfilled: alone in the magnitude of his grief, alone in his aimless guilt, alone even in his loneliness. I am not sad, he would repeat to himself over and over, I am not sad. As if he might one day convince himself. Or fool himself. Or convince others--the only thing worse than being sad is for others to know that you are sad. I am not sad. I am not sad. Because his life had unlimited potential for happiness, insofar as it was an empty white room. He would fall asleep with his heart at the foot of his bed, like some domesticated animal that was no part of him at all. And each morning he would wake with it again in the cupboard of his rib cage, having become a little heavier, a little weaker, but still pumping. And by the midafternoon he was again overcome with the desire to be somewhere else, someone else, someone else somewhere else. I am not sad. I am always sad, I think. Perhaps this signifies that I am not sad at all, because sadness is something lower than your normal disposition, and I am always the same thing. Perhaps I am the only person in the world, then, who never becomes sad. Perhaps I am lucky. But he also knew that there is an inflationary aspect to love, and that should his mother, or Rose, or any of those who loved him find out about each other, they would not be able to help but feel of lesser value. He knew that I love you also means, I love you more than anyone loves you, or has loved you, or will live you, and also, I love you in a way that no one loves you, or has loved you, or will love you,and also, I love you in a way that I love no one else, and never have loved anyone else, and never will love anyone else. He knew that it is, by love's definition, impossible to love two people. But more than that, no unloving words were ever spoken, and everything was held up as another small piece of proof that it can be this way, it doesn't have to be that way; if there is no love in the world, we will make a new world, and we will give it heavy walls, and we will furnish it with soft red interiors, from the inside out, and give it a knocker that resonates like a diamond falling to a jeweler's felt so that we should never hear it. <br> <br> Love me, because love doesn't exist, and I have tried everything that does.
