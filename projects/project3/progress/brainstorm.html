    <p>My collection consists of 100 records of typography specifically found and captured in New York City, each is non-edited and taken on phones. </p>

    <br>
    <br>

    <p>The original concept came from my interest in documenting the mundane and observing the creative aspects of this city. As a space that is so rich in arts and culture, I thought this would be a great way to document one part of it that is everywhere around us: typography. To keep the originality and aesthetics of the image to be casual, the records would not be edited but can be cropped to make sure the content can be seen properly. The quality of the image would be however they are captured, preferably on a mobile device. The majority of this collection would be from me, with some submissions from other creatives. There is no limit to the time of day or location, as long as it is in New York City. </p>

    <p>I was drawn to this <span><a href="https://aup.e-flux.com/">site</a></span> by the way it is organized like an archive. The filter also allows the viewer to choose their own way of navigation (text, image, or all).</p>

    <p>Although this <span><a href="http://websafe2k16.com/">site</a></span> appears to be more straightforward in the interaction aspect, I am intrigued by the anonymity in each stories.</p>
