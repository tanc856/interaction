    <p>Raye's collection consists of cityscapes from New York and Korea, taken from a variety of locations and time of day.  </p>

    <br>
    <br>

    <p>The concept of this collection originates from Raye's interest in photography and documenting the city silhouette in combination with the change in the sky. The image content consists of a unique perspective from one part of the city and usually highlights the citylights or the sky. All the images will remain in their original form with no cropping or masking. The quality of the image would be low-med resolution since it is taken on a mobile device. The images come from Raye's own collection of photos she has taken over the years, with no limit in location or time of day.  </p>

    <p>I was drawn to this <span><a href="https://aup.e-flux.com/">site</a></span> by the way it organizes the pictures into a circle/loop. It would work well with my collection if I organize them by the time they are captured to create a clock-like navigation.  </p>

    <p>Although this <span><a href="http://websafe2k16.com/">site</a></span> appears to be more straightforward in the interaction aspect, I am intrigued by the anonymity in each stories.</p>
