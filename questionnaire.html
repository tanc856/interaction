		<h1>PUCD 2126<br>Assignment 1: Review and Experience Questionnaire</h1>

		<h2>Core 1 Interaction Review and Experience Questionnaire </h2>

		<h3>Fill out the following questionnaire to the best of your ability.</h3>

		<div>
			<p>Q: Do you have an previous experience with coding? Which classes have you already taken that explored
				HTML/CSS or Javascript? </p>
			<div>
				A: Yes! I began learning how to code last semester in Core 1: Interaction. My professor (June!) was fantastic and she made me fell in love with coding. We learned basic HTML/CSS.   
			</div>
			<br>

			<p>Q: If you have worked with code in the past, what parts of it made sense to you? Which parts were
				exciting?</p>
			<div>
				A: My favourite part about coding is the interactive part of it. Although HTML/CSS only dabble on user experience, there's so much you can do to make a <i> good </i> website. So far everything is pretty straight forward, so I am looking forward to new challenges this semester! 
			</div>
			<br>

			<p>Q: If you have worked with code in the past, which parts were the most confusing? What were the least
				interesting? </p>
			<div>
				A: There was definitely a learning curve when I was transitioning from HTML to CSS. I didn't understand how the two worked together and had trouble linking the files. The addition of CSS language was also the most confusing part. I would say the least interesting part of coding is the manual work when it comes to adjusting shapes or images. Coming from an Adobe background where you can just tweak anything with a swipe, this was the most frustrating part for me to get used to üòÖ
			</div>
			<br>

			<p>Q: Do you have any anxieties around coding, or learning to code? Is there anything I can do to help
				alleviate those anxieties in this class? </p>
			<div>
				A: I wouldn't say I have any anxieties around coding, since there are so many good online resources out there. My only worry would be not able to convey what my problem is when asking for help.
			</div>
			<br>

			<p>Q: In your own words, can you describe at a high level how the internet works? </p>
			<div>
				A: I believe internet is a shared space supported by a network that allows data to transfer from another. The network connects all the devices together by an ethernet cable (wifi or bluetooth).
			</div>
			<br>

			<p>Q: What is the difference between a webpage, a website, and a web server?</p>
			<div>
				A: A webpage is a single page of URL that can be open in a web browser. A website is a series of webpages linked together and sharing the same domain name. A web server is a computer hosting one or more websites.
			</div>
			<br>

			<p>Q: In your own words, what is HTML?</p>
			<div>
				A: HTML is the foundation of a website, it stands for "Hyper Text Markup Language". It is the standard markup language for webpage display. It is where front-end content lies without any styling or fancy layouts. 
			</div>
			<br>

			<p>Q: Using the 6 levels of HTML Heading elements, list your 6 favorite songs in order from most, to
				least, favorite.</p>

			<br>
			<br>

			<div class="songs">

			<p>Q: In your own words, what is CSS?</p>
			<div>
				A: CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a similar language to HTML, with the purpose to style and design layout for webpages. Some features include adding columns, spacing, background images, and other decorative features to enhance the user experience.

				<p><font color="red"><i>"A MUD (/m åd/; originally multi-user dungeon, with later variants multi-user dimension and
					multi-user domain) is a multiplayer real-time virtual world, usually text-based or
					storyboarded. MUDs combine elements of role-playing games, hack and slash, player versus player,
					interactive fiction, and online chat. Players can read or view descriptions of rooms, objects,
					other players, non-player characters, and actions performed in the virtual world. Players
					typically interact with each other and the world by typing commands that resemble a natural
					language."</i> </p>
			</div>

			<p>Q: Update the following inline CSS to make the class applied to the following HTML Paragraph Element

					}

					.class-three {}
				</style>
				<p class="class-two">
					"Traditional MUDs implement a role-playing video game set in a fantasy world populated by
					fictional characters, with players choosing classes in order to gain specific skills or
					powers. The objective of this sort of game is to slay monsters, explore a fantasy world,
					complete quests, go on adventures, create a story by roleplaying, and advance the created
					character. Many MUDs were fashioned around the dice-rolling rules of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons
					series of games."
				</p>
			</div>
			<br>


			<p>Q: In the following inline HTML Style Element, add CSS so that when Elements with the class
				'hover-class' are hovered that they will turn the color Blue.</p>
			<div>

				<style>
					.hover-class:hover{
  						color: blue;
					}
				</style>

				<p class="hover-class">
					"Most MUDs are run as hobbies and are free to play; some may accept donations or allow players
					to purchase virtual items, while others charge a monthly subscription fee. MUDs can be accessed
					via standard telnet clients, or specialized MUD clients, which are designed to improve the
					userexperience. Numerous games are listed at various web portals, such as The Mud Connector."
